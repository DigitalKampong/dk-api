"This one had been on my list to try out for a long time. A hugely popular Spanish place, reservations are a must. Plus also specify whether you want the regular dining area or the bar as the menus are different.
We tried the croquettes (amazing) and the chorizo with cheese (great) to start off. Their squid ink paella is very popular so we didn't get any of the tapas this time (but will be back to try just those some other time). Squid ink paella was excellent. For dessert we had the basque burnt cheesecake, the only item which I felt was a bit of a let down, didn't find it that different from a normal cheesecake (although it was still tasty). Had hoped for a flavor of more Spanish cheese in it.
Even though, its a superb place to try out Spanish cuisine in Singapore!",5,1,1
